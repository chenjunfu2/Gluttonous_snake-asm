This file contains important supplementary and

TD32INST.EXE
===============================================

Included in this distribution is TD32INST.EXE.
Use this program to modify the configuration
file, TDCONFIG32.TD or to create customized
configuration files.

USING SOURCE-LEVEL DEBUGGING
===============================================

To enable source-level debugging, use the -v
switch when compiling, and again when linking.
If the -v switch is specified at compile time
but not link time, ILINK32 will write an
invalid header to the .TDS file. When TD32
attempts to read the .TDS file, it fails with a
"not enough memory to load symbol table" error.

"PROGRAM HAS NO SYMBOL TABLE" MESSAGE 
===============================================
If a .TDS file is out of date (older than its
.EXE or .DLL), TD32 warns "Program has no
symbol table".


SCREEN BUFFER SETTINGS
===============================================
When run inside a console window, TD32 Debugger
uses the entire screen buffer for its display.
If the screen buffer is larger than the actual
window, parts of the TD32 display are hidden by
the edge of the console window. The user can
see more of the TD32 display by dragging the
edges of the window, but may be unable to see
the entire display without scrolling.
A procedure to eliminate this problem is
described in "Setting Console Window
Properties," below.

MOUSE SUPPORT
===============================================
TD32 supports use of a mouse, but is unable to
see mouse events if the console window has
QuickEdit Mode enabled. To disable QuickEdit
Mode, see "Setting Console Window Properties,"
below.

SETTING CONSOLE WINDOW PROPERTIES
===============================================

To eliminate the problems described above,
change the console settings before running
TD32.

(1) Click on the MS-DOS icon in the upper-left
corner of the console window, or press
ALT-Space.

(2) The window's system menu pops up. Click on
"Properties" or press P.

(3) The Proerties Dialog appears. To fix the
screen buffer problem, click on the "Layout"
tab. Adjust the width and height values for
"Screen Buffer Size" and/or "Window Size" until
they match. 

(4) To fix the mouse problem, click on the
"Options" tab. Clear the "QuickEdit Mode"
option box.

(5) Click on OK. A dialog box appears. Choose
"Modify shortcut which started this window."

You can have multiple Command Prompt shortcuts,
each with its own window properties. Copy the
Command Prompt.lnk file used in your Start Menu
and give it its own set of properties.
